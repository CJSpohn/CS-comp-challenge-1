# CS-comp-challenge-1
A comp challenge for intermission of Mod 2.

The purpose of this exercise was to practice matching a given comp while utilizing CSS grid. 

The original project spec can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/m1-static-comp).

While we were requested to stay true to the layout of the original comp, any decision regarding assets, color scheme, and content was up to us. I decided to spice things up from the original comp and give a shout out to my childhood by using Pokemon!

The colors were taken from this [Pokemon Logo Color Palette](https://www.designpieces.com/palette/pokemon-logo-color-palette-hex-and-rgb/) and my pokemon images were taken from this page on [freepngimg.com](https://freepngimg.com/games/pokemon). 

Additionally, the website is fully responsive with 3 different breakpoints, accomodating phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. 

The original comp given to us looked like this:
